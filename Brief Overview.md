# Netrual-Network

the code uses torch to build neutral network to recognize handwritten digits and contains the following procedures:

perform transformations on data | explore and analyze on images and tensors | check out the shape of the images and the labels | view some images from the training set | generate a grid of images in a random order | build the model in PyTorch | print sequential model | assign criterion to negative log-likelihood loss | integrate tensorboard | initialize a SGD optimizer | perform the training pass | predict the output and compute loss | perform backpropagation and optimize the weights | forward pass | add the loss to the tensorboard summary writer | optimizes its weights
